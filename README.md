# Károly Zsolnai Fehér's mathematical notes
This repository contains some of mathematical notes. Normally, I would keep these to myself, but who knows, maybe they provide an intuitive alternative to your studies. If you find any mistakes or would like to contribute, let me know! (**Link**)[karoly-zsolnai-feher.github.io].
