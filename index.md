This repository contains some of my mathematical notes. Normally, I would keep these to myself, but who knows, maybe they provide an intuitive alternative to your studies. If you find any mistakes or would like to contribute, let me know! The commits are available [**here**](https://github.com/karoly-zsolnai-feher/karoly-zsolnai-feher.github.io).
