# Coulomb's law

<img src="coulomb.png" width="550" style="display:block; margin: auto"> 

Given two electrically charged particles with charges $q_1$, $q_2$ that are $r$ distance apart, and $\hat{r}_{1,2}$, a unit vector pointing from $q_1$ to $q_2$, the force on point 2 due to 1 acting between them is 

$$\vec{F}_{1,2} = k\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}\hat{r}_{1,2}.$$

The first variable, $k=9\cdot 10^9=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$, is Coulomb’s constant. This equation is sign sensitive, i.e., if $q_1$ and $q_2$ are positive or they are both negative, the force will be in direction $\hat{r}_{1,2}$. If one is positive, the other is negative, it negates the direction of the force. After him, one unit of charge is called 1 Coulomb. It is quite reminiscent to how gravity works, in terms of magnitude, however, gravity is not sign sensitive.

We usually work with micro-Coulombs, or even less than that. The charge of one proton (or electron), i.e., $q_{p^+}=q_{e^-} \approx 1.6\cdot10^{-19}C$.

Electric forces are much more powerful than gravitational forces. Calculating these forces acting between two protons, $\frac{F_{el}}{F_{gr}}=10^{36}$, which means 36 orders of magnitude smaller. That is an incredibly large force pushing them apart. So what holds the nucleus together? Nuclear forces, which have to be even greater.

## Electroscope
It is an instrument that typically contains an aluminum foil and is therefore a conductor, i.e., if you touch it with a charged object, it gets positively charged. As this happens, these aluminum tinsels (tails) will all be positive, and “open up” as they start repelling each other. Humans are not good conductors, but you can also become a living electroscope by touching something positively charged, and having an electroscope in the other hand - it will open up. Your hair is also an electroscope and will stand up.
