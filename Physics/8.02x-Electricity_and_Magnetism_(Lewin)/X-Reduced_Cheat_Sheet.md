## Coulomb's Law
This gives the force on point 2 due to 1,

$$\vec{F}_{1,2} = k\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}\hat{r}_{1,2},$$

while the electric field arising from a test charge $p$ is

$$\vec{E}_p=\frac{\vec{F}}{q}.$$

Fore more charges, the law of superposition applies.


## Electric flux
The electric flux that goes through a surface is given as

$$d\Phi = \vec{E}\cdot \hat{n}dA = \vec{E}\cdot \vec{dA} =  E \, dA \cos \theta,$$ 

where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{E}$ and $\hat{n}$. 

Positive charges are hairdryers, negative charges are vacuum cleaners.

## Gaussâ€™s Law

The electric flux going through a closed surface $S$ is mainly dependent on the charges within this surface, i.e.,

$$\Phi=\oint_S \vec{E}\cdot\vec{dA}=\frac{\sum Q}{\epsilon_0}.$$

There is a potent electric field between charged plates.

## Eletric potential

The **electric potential** is the work *per unit charge* that I have to do to go from $\infty \rightarrow p$.   Note that **potential is work per unit charge**, where if I put the amount of charge I need to carry back into the equation, I get **work**.

## Movement between potentials

In an electric field, positive charges will move from a higher potential to a lower potential. The amount of energy released during the journey is related to the difference in kinetic energies at the start and end point.

## Equipotential surfaces
They are always perpendicular to $\vec{E}$, i.e., $E= - \nabla V.$

**Metals are equipotential surfaces**, as long as there is no charge moving inside them. When induction happens, the charges move automatically until there is no force on them anymore (they try to "kill" the electric field).
