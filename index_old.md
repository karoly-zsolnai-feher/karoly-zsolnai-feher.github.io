M = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
x_{11} & x_{12} & \ldots \\
x_{21} & x_{22} & \ldots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ldots \\
\end{array} \right)
$$

## Gauss’s Law

The electric flux going through a closed surface $S$ is mainly dependent on the charges within this surface, i.e.,

$$\Phi=\oint_S \vec{E}\cdot\vec{dA}=\frac{\sum Q}{\epsilon_0}.$$

Note that Gauss’ law holds independent of the shape of the bag and the charge distribution within the bag. Later, in this course, most of these bags will show different kinds of symmetry, e.g., spherical, cylindrical, or planar.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/karoly-zsolnai-feher/karoly-zsolnai-feher.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/karoly-zsolnai-feher/karoly-zsolnai-feher.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
